# Project Elixir [![Download Project Elixir](https://img.shields.io/sourceforge/dt/project-elixir.svg)](https://sourceforge.net/projects/project-elixir/files/twelve/) 

Project Elixir is another aftermarket AOSP ROM which offers minimal UI enhancement and a ROM that offers great performance, security and stability, while remaining close to stock Android. Most of the OEMs' these days will provide slow and untimely updates, but we don't do that here. We closely follow Google to bring the latest updates to our users, and even prolong support for devices that have been declared obsolete by OEMs. Our ROMs' source code is open-source, secure, stable, and outstanding. Your experience while using Project Elixir will be butter smooth without compromising the quality of the Android experience. In short, it's perfectly balanced between great performance, security, stability, minimal UI & awesome features. So join us and enjoy the beauty of Android. Build Project Elixir on your respective devices!
