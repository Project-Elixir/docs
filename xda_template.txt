[B]NOTE[/B]: It is STRONGLY recommended to fully wipe your device before flashing and please avoid restoring system apps and system data with Titanium Backup (or with any backup/restore app) as this can cause stability issues that are very hard to debug, restoring regular apps is fine. If you believe you know what you're doing - then fine, go ahead, but please don't complain if you experience any strange behavior.

[B][SIZE=4]As you know build is free but building ROM needs a server. And Maintaining source and device stuff needs a server and it's pretty expensive for a student. It will be really helpful and appreciated if you donate or contribute to us. Also if you have any queries related to donation you can freely message -> [URL='https://forum.xda-developers.com/m/sourav24071999.9437589/']Saurav (Founder & lead Dev)[/URL] [/SIZE][/B][/B][/SIZE]
